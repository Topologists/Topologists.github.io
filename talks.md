<summary><b>程哲驰(武汉大学)：A Symplectic Approach of Khovanov Homology
</b></summary>
摘要：There are many different approaches of Khovanov homology. As for this talk, we will mainly be interested in a version from symplectic geometry, called symplectic Khovanov homology.  It is conjecturally isomorphic to Khovanov homology. In 2020, Abouzaid and Smith proved this conjecture over characteristic-zero fields, while the more general cases remain open. In this talk, we start with comparing the gradings on symplectic Khovanov homology and Khovanov homology, and then discuss some recent progress on the conjecture.

<summary><b>何思奇(中科院)：Z2 harmonic 1-forms: connections in topology and geometry</b></summary>
摘要：Z2 harmonic spinors and forms extend the concept of quadratic differentials on Riemann surfaces to higher dimensions, creating significant links with gauge theory, low-dimensional topology, and calibrated geometry. According to Taubes, Z2 harmonic 1-forms serve as essential boundaries in various gauge theory equations, particularly in the context of flat SL(2,C) connections. In the first session, we will provide an overview of this field, highlighting contributions from Takahashi, Parker, Walpuski, Doan, Donaldson, Haydys, Mazzeo, Chen, and others. The second session will address a challenge question posed by Taubes-Wu concerning the existence and rigidity of the tangent cone model for Z2 harmonic 1-forms. We will discuss the application of finite group representation theory to this problem.

 <summary><b>谷世杰(东北大学)：Compactifications of manifolds</b></summary> 
  摘要：In 1966, Larry Siebenmann once mused that his work (PhD thesis) was initiated at a time "when 'respectable' geometric topology was necessarily compact." That attitude has long since faded; today's topological landscape is filled with research in which noncompact spaces are primary objects. However, major successes in compactifying manifolds included here are fundamental to manifold topology: Stallings' characterization of Euclidean spaces, Siebenmann's collaring theorem, and our recent Gu-Guilbault's manifold completion theorem. In the first part, I will provide quick access to some of these results by weaving them together with common interpretations. In the second part, I will introduce several open questions on this topic. I will focus on clarifying the relationship between pseudo-collarability and Z-compactifiability, two main extensions on completable manifolds. I will construct counterexamples to the statement that Z-compactifiability implies pseudo-collarability. The constructions are based on knot theory and 4D topology. If time permits, I’ll show the reverse statement holds for manifolds of dimension at least six, i.e., pseudo-collarability implies Z-compactifiability.

<summary><b>李友林(上海交通大学)：On contact solid tori in contact 3-manifolds</b></summary>
摘要：Contact solid tori in contact 3-manifolds are closely related to Legendrian knots and Legendrian cable knots. In this talk, I will present several recent results concerning contact solid tori in contact 3-manifolds. This is joint work in progress with John Etnyre and Bulent Tosun.

  预备报告摘要：Convex surface theory is an essential tool in studying contact 3-manifolds. In this talk, I will briefly introduce the convex surface theory and demonstrate how it is used to study tight contact structures.

<summary><b>潘宇(天津大学)：Legendrian knots and exact Lagrangian fillings</b></summary> 
    摘要：Exact Lagrangian surfaces are important objects in the derived Fukaya category. Augmentations are objects of the augmentation category, which is the contact analog of the Fukaya category. In this talk, we discuss various relations between augmentations and exact Lagrangian surfaces. On one hand, we use augmentations to build obstructions for exact Lagrangian cobordisms. On the other hand, we realize augmentations, which is an algebraic object, fully geometrically via exact Lagrangian surfaces.

 <summary><b>杨璟玲(厦门大学)：Knot concordance, slice genus and Heegaard Floer homology</b></summary>
摘要：In this talk, we will discuss the 4-dimensional properties of knots, knot concordance and knot slice genus, which play central roles in low-dimensional topology. Heegaard Floer ho- mology has proved to be an effective tool in studying low-dimensional topology, particularly in advancing the understanding of knot concordance. We will begin with an expository introduction to some elementary notions, followed by a review of results in knot concordance stemming from Heegaard Floer theory. We will also discuss our recent progress in this field. This is a joint work with Zhongtao Wu.

<summary><b>张俊(中国科学技术大学)：Givental’s non-linear Maslov index via Floer cones</b></summary>
摘要：In this talk, we will present how to apply a recently-developed Floer theory on a fillable contact manifold, called the contact Hamiltonian Floer homology, to generate a homological machinery that replaces the classical Givental non-linear Maslov indices. As a key step, we will emphasize the role of the homological mapping cone from this Floer theory (called a Floer cone) and its fundamental role in reflecting local data of periodic orbits. As an application, the multiplicity of translated points, serving as a natural generalization of fixed points in contact Hamiltonian dynamics, will be deduced. This talk is based on joint work with Dylan Cant and Igor Uljarevic. <br>
预备报告题目：Contact geometry and its associated dynamics. <br>
预备报告摘要：In this preliminary talk, we will recall some general background on contact geometry, mainly focusing on the Hamiltonian dynamics on a contact manifold. In particular, Reeb dynamics and various studies on closed Reeb orbits will be elaborated; orderability from Eliashberg-Polterovich, together with its most updated progress in terms of the metric geometry, will also be covered. If time permits, we will outline how the Hamiltonian dynamics behave in the relative situation, that is, on Legendrian submanifolds or more generally on contact coisotropic submanifolds.
