<p><b>程哲驰(武汉大学)：A Symplectic Approach of Khovanov Homology
</b>
<details>
<summary>摘要：</summary>
There are many different approaches of Khovanov homology. As for this talk, we will mainly be interested in a version from symplectic geometry, called symplectic Khovanov homology.  It is conjecturally isomorphic to Khovanov homology. In 2020, Abouzaid and Smith proved this conjecture over characteristic-zero fields, while the more general cases remain open. In this talk, we start with comparing the gradings on symplectic Khovanov homology and Khovanov homology, and then discuss some recent progress on the conjecture.

<p><b>何思奇(中科院)：Z2 harmonic 1-forms: connections in topology and geometry</b>
 <details>
<summary>摘要：</summary>
Z2 harmonic spinors and forms extend the concept of quadratic differentials on Riemann surfaces to higher dimensions, creating significant links with gauge theory, low-dimensional topology, and calibrated geometry. According to Taubes, Z2 harmonic 1-forms serve as essential boundaries in various gauge theory equations, particularly in the context of flat SL(2,C) connections. In the first session, we will provide an overview of this field, highlighting contributions from Takahashi, Parker, Walpuski, Doan, Donaldson, Haydys, Mazzeo, Chen, and others. The second session will address a challenge question posed by Taubes-Wu concerning the existence and rigidity of the tangent cone model for Z2 harmonic 1-forms. We will discuss the application of finite group representation theory to this problem.

<p><b>谷世杰(东北大学)：Compactifications of manifolds</b>
  <details>
 <summary>摘要：</summary> In 1966, Larry Siebenmann once mused that his work (PhD thesis) was initiated at a time "when 'respectable' geometric topology was necessarily compact." That attitude has long since faded; today's topological landscape is filled with research in which noncompact spaces are primary objects. However, major successes in compactifying manifolds included here are fundamental to manifold topology: Stallings' characterization of Euclidean spaces, Siebenmann's collaring theorem, and our recent Gu-Guilbault's manifold completion theorem. In the first part, I will provide quick access to some of these results by weaving them together with common interpretations. In the second part, I will introduce several open questions on this topic. I will focus on clarifying the relationship between pseudo-collarability and Z-compactifiability, two main extensions on completable manifolds. I will construct counterexamples to the statement that Z-compactifiability implies pseudo-collarability. The constructions are based on knot theory and 4D topology. If time permits, I’ll show the reverse statement holds for manifolds of dimension at least six, i.e., pseudo-collarability implies Z-compactifiability.

<p><b>潘宇(天津大学)：Legendrian knots and exact Lagrangian fillings</b>
   <details>
<summary>摘要：</summary> Exact Lagrangian surfaces are important objects in the derived Fukaya category. Augmentations are objects of the augmentation category, which is the contact analog of the Fukaya category. In this talk, we discuss various relations between augmentations and exact Lagrangian surfaces. On one hand, we use augmentations to build obstructions for exact Lagrangian cobordisms. On the other hand, we realize augmentations, which is an algebraic object, fully geometrically via exact Lagrangian surfaces.

<p><b>杨璟玲(厦门大学)：KNOT CONCORDANCE, SLICE GENUS AND HEEGAARD FLOER HOMOLOGY </b>
  <details>
 <summary>摘要：</summary>
 In this talk, we will discuss the 4-dimensional properties of knots, knot concordance and knot slice genus, which play central roles in low-dimensional topology. Heegaard Floer ho- mology has proved to be an effective tool in studying low-dimensional topology, particularly in advancing the understanding of knot concordance. We will begin with an expository introduction to some elementary notions, followed by a review of results in knot concordance stemming from Heegaard Floer theory. We will also discuss our recent progress in this field. This is a joint work with Zhongtao Wu.
